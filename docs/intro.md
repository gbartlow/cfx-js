This library can be installed via bower, for browser use

And npm, for use in Node applications, or with Browserify

    npm install cfx-js

To include the code, either

    var cfx = require('cfx-js')

or

```html
<script src='bower_components/cfx-js/dist/cfx.js'></script>
```

From that point on, everything in this library will be accessible via the cfx object.
